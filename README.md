# Pyxel Smash
## A small pyxel video game project made in the purpose of an assignment
This project is a group project originally made by three people.
It functions as a base platformer where 2 to 4 players fight together to be the last survivor.
It works on the python library named pyxel [pyxel github](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)

This project contains 5 essential files:
* game.py which contains the individual class game allowing to run the game. It also contains the game test with a basic map and basic characters if you run the file as main
* classes.py which contains most of the essential classes to run the game such as Hitbox, Character or Map as well as the basic map and characters used for the game test
* game_constants.py which contains most constants regulating the game. free to you to modify them to your will
* mapping.json which contains the touch mapping in a json file. it is also freely modifiable to answer your needs
* resources.pyxres which contains all resources used in the project, used via the pyxel library

To play, you have to launch game.py or use the Game class with your own map and characters.
You will then get to the home screen, left click and access to the Parameters menu.
There, you can modify the player number, and only then the character of each player by clicking on the corresponding character icon.
Each character has its corresponding stats.
Finally, press start and enjoy the game!

The game is made with pyxel 2.0.4 and python 3.11.5

This project is made to be open to update, though there might not be any.
Feel free to go through it, use it, and modify it!
